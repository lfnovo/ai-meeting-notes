### Create EntityLowUsage Pydantic model [Completed âœ…]

**Location**: `backend/app/models.py`
- Added `EntityLowUsage` model with entity data + meeting context
- Includes fields: id, name, type_slug, description, created_at, meeting_id, meeting_title, meeting_date, type_name, color_class
- Follows existing model patterns with proper Pydantic Field validation
- Added Config class with from_attributes = True

- Returns entities that appear in exactly 1 meeting with meeting context
- Follows existing async connection patterns and error handling
- Added proper EntityLowUsage import

### Verify delete_entity CASCADE behavior [Completed âœ…]

**Location**: `backend/app/database.py`
- Reviewed existing `delete_entity()` method - found critical issue!
- **IMPORTANT FIX**: Original method didn't handle CASCADE deletion properly
- Enhanced method to manually delete from meeting_entities table first
- Added foreign key constraint enabling (PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON)
- Added transaction handling with rollback on errors
- Added existence check and proper error handling

### Add GET /entities/low-usage endpoint [Completed âœ…]

- Added proper documentation and status codes
- Uses get_db() dependency injection pattern

### Comments:
- **Critical Fix**: Discovered and fixed a data integrity issue in existing delete_entity method
- The original implementation was leaving orphaned records in meeting_entities table
- Enhanced CASCADE deletion now prevents data corruption
- All new code follows existing project patterns and conventions
- Backend foundation is now solid and ready for frontend integration

## PHASE 2: Backend API Completion & Testing [Partially Complete âœ…]

- Handles multiple entity deletions with our enhanced CASCADE delete_entity() method
- Proper error handling and detailed response format
- Handles partial failures gracefully with success/failure feedback
- Tested with various scenarios - all working correctly

### Create comprehensive backend tests [Deferred ðŸ“‹]
